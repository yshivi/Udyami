    <h1>Our <span>Mission</span></h1>
    <p>
      There is almost ZERO participation of rural women in the tech field.
       We want 2 out of every 5 software developers to be rural women within the next 5 years.
       That's why we entered the field of technology so that village girls get motivated by seeing us.
